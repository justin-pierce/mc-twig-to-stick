# mc-twig-to-stick
simple datapack that lets Forester turn twigs to sticks

## Installation

1. Download the datapack by clicking the latest release and downloading the source code zip file.
2. Extract the zip file. This should create a folder named something like `mc-twig-to-stick-1.0.0` with the contents of the datapack inside the folder.
3. Move the folder to the world save you want to apply the datapack to.
    - for local saves, it will go in `saves/<SAVE_NAME>/datapacks` (replace `<SAVE_NAME>` with the name of your save)
    - for servers, it will go in `world/datapacks` (`world` could be something else if you changed it)
4. Restart the game/server for it to take effect (you can also try the `/reload` command while it's running, but I haven't tested this).
5. To verify it's installed, you can type `/datapack list enabled` and find `file/mc-twig-to-stick-#.#.#` listed in the output. If you have the JEI mod, you can also search for `twig` and press U to view uses, and view the Forester tab showing they can now convert twigs to sticks.
